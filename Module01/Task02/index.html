    <h2>"Heat" Mission</h2>
    <p><b>"Heat"</b> is the fifteenth campaign mission of <em style="color: darkgreen;">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered.</em> It is the penultimate mission of Act 2. In gameplay, it's both a redux and a reversal of <class style="color: darkgreen;">Safehouse,</class> while in story it is the <class style="color: darkgreen;">SAS</class> team's fight to survive against <class style="color: darkgreen;">Imran Zakhaev</class>'s supporters after the capture (and execution) of <class style="color: darkgreen;">Khaled Al-Asad</class>.</p>

    <p>The original plan is to deploy charges (antipersonnel explosives) at "Phase Line Alpha" near a church, and "Phase Line Bravo" near a tavern, then to hold out until extraction at a landing zone (LZ) at the top of the hill. However, after the simultaneous detonations at Alpha, the enemy (mistaking the S.A.S. team for a much larger force) eventually resort to the mortars to force them back. MacTavish then mans a Minigun inside a crashed Black Hawk helicopter, holding off the enemy until enemy helicopters start deploying troops.</p>

    <h2>Downloadable Content</h2>
    <p>On April 4, 2008, Infinity Ward released the <class style="color: darkgreen;">Variety Map Pack</class> on the Xbox Live Marketplace. This package was subsequently released in the PlayStation Network Store. It includes four maps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: darkgreen;">Broadcast</li>
        <li style="color: darkgreen;">Creek</li>
        <li style="color: darkgreen;">Chinatown</li>
        <li style="color: darkgreen;">Killhouse</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It costs 800 MS points from the Live Marketplace and originally cost $9.99 or Â£6.99 from the PlayStation Network. Thanks to sponsoring by Nvidia, the PC version of the map pack is included for free in the 1.6 patch. PS3 & Xbox 360 users in some markets are able to download the pack for free upon entering a code supplied with some 2008 game discs, in a limited offer which celebrates <em>Call of Duty 4</em> receiving a "Game of the Year" award. The PC version included one more exclusive map, called <class style="color: darkgreen;">"Winter Crash"</class>, which is basically a winterized version of the original <class style="color: darkgreen;">"Crash"</class> map, with airstrikes dropping bombs that look like presents and the planes themselves sounding like sleighs, and in the background the player can hear Christmas songs, bells ringing and Santa Claus laughing.</p>
